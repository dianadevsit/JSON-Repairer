  <h2 style="margin-top:0;">Project Overview: JSON Debug Tool</h2>
  <p>
    This project was created to identify and explain common JSON syntax errors that often come up in support and integration work.
  </p>
  <p>It includes:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>A built-in JSON validator that allows users to paste and test their own JSON</li>
    <li>Static examples of common mistakes, such as trailing commas, missing quotes, and mismatched brackets</li>
    <li>Simple explanations to help users understand the source of each error and how to correct it</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    The tool is designed based on real scenarios I've encountered while supporting clients working with APIs and structured data.
